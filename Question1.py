# Puzzle No.1 â€“ Monday 3 July
# Take the digits 1,2,3 up to 9 in numerical order and put either a plus sign or a minus sign or neither between
#  the digits to make a sum that adds up to 100.
#  For example, one way of achieving this is: 1 + 2 + 34 - 5 + 67 - 8 + 9 = 100, which uses six plusses and minuses.
#  What is the fewest number of plusses and minuses you need to do this?

# Brute force baby

# Take a number and produce a string with its value at a given base
